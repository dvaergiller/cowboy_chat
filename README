Very simple usage example of the cowboy and bullet projects.

It is a simple web based chat application which, using the "bullet"
handler attempts to use websockets whenever the client supports it but
falls back on long polling if necessary.

The server is hard-coded to listen on port 8080 and /index.html is
required in the URL to access the chat.
